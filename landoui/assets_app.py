In order to build assets, the `flask assets build` command requires a 
reference to a python file which has an `app` variable available to import.
This file provides that by initializing the flask app with basic configuration.
If you just want to build assets run `invoke build_assets`, the output can
be found in the landoui/static/build folder.
